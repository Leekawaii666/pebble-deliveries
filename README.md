# Pebble Deliveries
## A delivery tracker app for Pebble

This app is split up into three parts:
* `server` - This contains the code for the backend/proxy side of the application, this is for in the future when I receive an API key for the deliveries API and need to keep it private. It is hosted on deliveries.memester.xyz.
* `config` - This is the config page that is used from within the Pebble app to add deliveries. It is hosted on Github pages.
* `app` - This is the app itself, written in PebbleJS/
